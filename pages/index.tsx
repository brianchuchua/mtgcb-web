          All the features from the old MTG CB are still being brought over one at a time, along with improved interfaces.
        </li>
        <li>Changes made to your collection here are also reflected on the old MTG CB.</li>
        <li>If something is missing, it's most likely still being worked on.</li>
        <li>We'll soon move on to adding tokens, custom collection goals, and foreign cards.</li>
        <li>Best experienced on desktop, but mobile optimizations are in progress.</li>

      Getting Started
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph component="div">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Check out the <u>Browse</u> section on the left, even if you're not logged in, to browse every card and set in Magic with a brand
          new set of filters and viewing options.
        </li>
        <li>You can also log into your existing MTG CB account by clicking the menu on the top-right.</li>
        <li>
          This will unveil the Collection menu option (which will let you edit <em>the same collection</em> as the old MTG CB site), so
          you're welcome to bounce between both experiences.

      Roadmap
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph component="div">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Limited Edition Alpha (Complete): Initial feature parity progress with the current MTG CB. This is being moved one piece at a
          time.
        </li>
        <li>
          ‚è≥ Limited Edition Beta (In Progress): As many of the new MTG CB features that can be squeezed in here (Tokens, Custom Collection
          Goals, and Foreign Cards), although they'll be deferred if more current feature improvements are needed. I also snuck in some of
          Combo Winter here.
        </li>
        <li>Unlimited Edition: Full release of the new MTG CB.</li>
        <li>
          Combo Winter: I need to invest some time in upgrading the libraries used by the new MTG CB. I'll do this after the main release.
        </li>
        <li>Revised Edition: The v1.1 update adding a single new requested feature.</li>
        <li>
          Future Updates: Future updates will follow the same pattern of v1.2, v1.3, and so on, each adding a single new feature in focused
          iterations.
        </li>
      </ul>

    next. Feel free to send me any feedback via email, Facebook, Discord or Patreon! <em>There will be bugs. üêõ</em>
